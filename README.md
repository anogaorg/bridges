# bridges
Integrate sporadic workflows


# Quick Notes
This is an experimental project which could have real use for someone some day. Or not. Nbd.

Went back and forth, but deciding that I'll mainly work off of the main branch until further notice. If this shapes up nicely, then I'll probably start cutting releases. If it blows up, well then, it's probably a good problem to have when that time comes.

This project was originally built using 2 examples on the internet: [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [electron-vue-spring example](https://github.com/wuruoyun/electron-vue-spring).

Stumbled upon those because I'm new to both Electron and React.

Also because:

1) I'm primarily interested in learning new technology. If something is unnecessary but might vaguely work with this idea I have in my ahead, then I'll probably try implementing it. Giving myself permission now to make bad architectural decisions in favor of learning opportunities.
2) This all started because I wanted Airflow mechanics, but not on a schedule. Something like Dagster seems like it would be a good fit, but I haven't tried exploring that yet. I have a picture in my head of the user stories and use cases but it certainly hasn't been validated beyond my own professional experiences. In short, I'm aiming to integrating pieces of a sporadic workflow using pipelines and reusable pipeline components. Pretty much what you would expect out of Airflow and Dagster. I don't suspect this will bear new concepts, but going back to #1, I'm mostly here for the learning journey.
3) So far the only guiding principles have been: Electron seems cool and I've wanted to make Desktop Applications for a while now and I really want to use Scala and the Akka ecosystem. React was a pleasant surprise and changed my relationship with frontend so take that as you will.
4) Ultimately just here to have fun. Quarantine and all.

Also excited about organizing my work and trying out more DevOps tools on GitHub, yeah!
